# Bitwarden

## Using the Extension
1. It is best to use Bitwarden through a browser extension, such that you can seamlessly save and autofill usernames and passwords. Bitwarden offers extensions for:
   * Tor Browser
   * Firefox (with SOCKS5 proxy enabled)
   * Brave (with SOCKS5 proxy enabled)
2. After installing the extension, insert you Bitwarden ".onion" URL into the settings menu and hit save.
3. Create your account and log in. **Important**: you are creating an account _with yourself_ on your _own Embassy_! There are no third parties involved.
4. For best security, we also recommend enabling 2FA in the settings menu.

**Note**: if you lose your master password or 2FA, you will be permanently locked out of your account. _There is no way to recover your passwords_, so be sure to write down your master password and store it somewhere safe. Same goes with your 2FA backup.

## Using the Website

1. By accessing your personal Bitwarden website directly, you can perform advanced features not available through the extension, such as create and manage organizations, as well as change your master password. To access your Bitwarden website, copy/paste its ".onion" URL into any Tor-enabled browser. Options include:
   * Start9 Consulate (recommended)
   * Tor Browser
   * Firefox (with SOCKS5 proxy enabled)
   * Brave (with SOCKS5 proxy enabled)
2. Bookmark the site for future visits. You can even store you Bitwarden master password in Bitwarden for login convenience, but be sure to also have it written down somewhere else too!

## Backups

It is critical that you backup your Bitwarden data. That way, if anything happens to your Embassy, you can recover. **Important**: Backups are doubly encrypted using your Embassy Master password AND you Bitwarden master password, so you will need both to recover your data.
